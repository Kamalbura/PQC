# Post-Quantum Cryptographic Security Framework for Drone Communications: A Comprehensive Research Analysis

## Abstract

This research presents a comprehensive post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) security framework specifically designed for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications in resource-constrained environments. As quantum computing advances threaten current cryptographic standards, this work addresses the critical need for quantum-resistant security in drone-ground station communications while optimizing for power consumption, computational efficiency, and real-time operational requirements on Raspberry Pi 4B platforms.

The framework implements a multi-tier architecture incorporating NIST-standardized PQC algorithms organized by security levels, an intelligent priority-based scheduler for dynamic algorithm selection, and secure MQTT communication protocols with mutual TLS (mTLS). Note: DDoS detection components are out of scope for this repository version and intentionally omitted per project direction.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Research Motivation

The rapid advancement of quantum computing poses an existential threat to current cryptographic standards used in critical infrastructure, including unmanned aerial systems. Traditional asymmetric cryptographic algorithms such as RSA, ECDSA, and Diffie-Hellman key exchange are vulnerable to Shor's algorithm when implemented on sufficiently powerful quantum computers. For drone communications, this vulnerability represents a significant security risk that could compromise mission-critical operations, surveillance data, and autonomous navigation systems.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

Existing drone communication systems rely heavily on classical cryptographic protocols that will become obsolete in the quantum era. However, the transition to post-quantum cryptography presents unique challenges in UAV environments:

1. **Resource Constraints**: Drones operate under strict power, weight, and computational limitations
2. **Real-time Requirements**: Flight control systems require low-latency communication
3. **Security vs. Performance Trade-offs**: PQC algorithms often have larger key sizes and higher computational costs
4. **Dynamic Threat Landscape**: Need for adaptive security measures based on threat assessment

### 1.3 Research Contributions

This research makes several significant contributions to the field of secure UAV communications:

1. **NIST Security Level Framework**: Systematic organization of PQC algorithms by security levels (128-bit, 192-bit, 256-bit) with comprehensive performance analysis
2. **Adaptive Scheduler Design**: Intelligent algorithm selection based on threat level, power budget, and performance requirements
3. **Secure Communication Protocol**: MQTT-based real-time algorithm switching with mTLS authentication
4. **Operational Security Practices**: Heartbeat monitoring via MQTT and robust error handling
5. **Raspberry Pi Implementation**: Practical deployment on resource-constrained hardware with detailed performance metrics

## 2. Literature Review

### 2.2 UAV Communication Security Challenges

Previous research has identified several key challenges in implementing cryptographic security in UAV systems:

#### Power Consumption Analysis
- Classical algorithms typically consume 5-15W during cryptographic operations
- Network I/O dominates power consumption (85-90% of total crypto-related power usage)
- Battery life critically depends on cryptographic efficiency

#### Computational Overhead
- Real-time flight control requires sub-millisecond response times
- Cryptographic operations must not interfere with mission-critical systems
- ARM Cortex-A72 processors provide sufficient compute for most PQC operations

#### Network Reliability
- UAV communications are susceptible to jamming and denial-of-service attacks
- Intermittent connectivity requires robust error handling
- Quality of Service (QoS) requirements vary by message type (telemetry vs. commands)

### 2.3 Related Work in PQC Implementation

Several research groups have investigated PQC implementation in constrained environments:

- **NIST Lightweight Cryptography**: Focus on IoT and embedded systems

However, limited research exists specifically addressing UAV communication requirements with comprehensive system integration.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 System Architecture Design

Our research implements a comprehensive PQC framework with the following architectural components:

#### 3.1.1 NIST Security Level Organization

The framework organizes PQC algorithms into three security categories based on NIST security levels:

```
Level 1 (128-bit equivalent security):
- ML-KEM-512 (Key Encapsulation)  
- Falcon-512 (Digital Signatures)
- SLH-DSA-128s (Hash-based Signatures)
- ASCON-128 (Authenticated Encryption)

Level 3 (192-bit equivalent security):
- ML-KEM-768 (Key Encapsulation)
- ML-DSA-65 (Digital Signatures) 
- SLH-DSA-192s (Hash-based Signatures)
- Camellia-192 (Symmetric Encryption)

Level 5 (256-bit equivalent security):
- ML-KEM-1024 (Key Encapsulation)
- ML-DSA-87 (Digital Signatures)
- Falcon-1024 (Digital Signatures)
- SLH-DSA-256s (Hash-based Signatures)
```

#### 3.1.2 Proxy-Based Communication Architecture

The system implements algorithm-specific proxy pairs that intercept and process MAVLink traffic:

- **Drone Proxies**: Handle encryption of outgoing telemetry and decryption of incoming commands
- **GCS Proxies**: Handle decryption of incoming telemetry and encryption of outgoing commands
- **Transparent Operation**: Applications remain unaware of cryptographic processing

#### 3.1.3 Network Protocol Design

Standardized port allocation ensures consistent communication:
- **Port 5800**: TCP key exchange for all algorithms
- **Ports 5810-5812**: UDP command flow (plaintext → encrypted → decrypted)
- **Ports 5820-5822**: UDP telemetry flow (encrypted → plaintext → decrypted)

### 3.2 Priority-Based Scheduler Implementation

#### 3.2.1 Algorithm Selection Criteria

The scheduler evaluates algorithms based on multiple factors:

1. **Security Requirements**: Minimum security level based on threat assessment
2. **Performance Requirements**: Maximum acceptable latency and throughput
3. **Power Budget**: Available power for cryptographic operations
4. **Resource Availability**: CPU and memory constraints

#### 3.2.2 Scoring Algorithm

Each algorithm receives a composite score:

```
Score = (Security_Weight × Security_Score) + 
        (Performance_Weight × Performance_Score) + 
        (Power_Weight × Power_Score)
```

Where weights are adjusted based on current operational mode:
- **Emergency Mode**: High security weight (0.6), low power weight (0.1)
- **Normal Operation**: Balanced weights (0.33 each)
- **Power Conservation**: High power weight (0.6), moderate security weight (0.2)

### 3.3 MQTT Communication Protocol

#### 3.3.1 Secure Communication Design

The MQTT implementation provides:

- **Mutual TLS Authentication**: Both drone and GCS authenticate using X.509 certificates
- **Topic-Based Algorithm Switching**: Real-time algorithm changes via control messages
- **Heartbeat Monitoring**: Continuous connectivity verification
- **Quality of Service**: Guaranteed delivery for critical messages (QoS 2)

#### 3.3.2 Message Flow Architecture

```
Command Flow (GCS → Drone):
1. GCS publishes encrypted command to "crypto/commands/[algorithm]"
2. Drone receives and decrypts using current algorithm
3. Drone publishes ACK to "crypto/ack/commands"

Telemetry Flow (Drone → GCS):
1. Drone publishes encrypted telemetry to "crypto/telemetry/[algorithm]"
2. GCS receives and decrypts using current algorithm
3. GCS publishes ACK to "crypto/ack/telemetry"

Algorithm Switching:
1. Scheduler publishes switch request to "crypto/algorithm_switch"
2. Both endpoints confirm readiness via "crypto/switch_ready"
3. Synchronized switch occurs at predetermined timestamp
```

### 3.4 Measurement and Evaluation Plan

To ensure scientific rigor, all performance numbers must be measured on-target hardware (Raspberry Pi 4B) using the provided tooling. This project intentionally avoids fabricated metrics.

Measurement tooling:
